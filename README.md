# Lumi Social Intelligence

**Memory, nuance, presence, and review-gated Live Surface for AI agents.**

Lumi Social Intelligence is the public-facing release doorway for three cooperating products plus Live Surface, which lets a host agent keep safe context warm without turning every available tool into an automatic side effect:

```text
Lumi Layered Memory -> Nuances -> Presence -> Live Surface
```

It gives agent runtimes a governed reflection layer: adaptive memory, nuance, and presence with confidence scoring, contradiction handling, user approval, skill evaluation, review, consent, repair, and explicit control boundaries for live host surfaces.

> **Status:** latest public release is **`v0.4.3`** — a Live Surface readiness release for Gateway-start warmed context, no first-use warmup in the user path, warm brief handoffs before simple familiar checks, and explicit acknowledgement before longer AutoResearch/tool waits. The original track began as a private, review-gated `v0.1.0` preview release; `v0.2` is a demo-evidence path, not a live automation claim. Earlier releases added review-gated Live Surface controls (`v0.4.0`), host-runtime native Telegram reaction payload evidence (`v0.4.1`), and Next-Step Care for instant/safe actions (`v0.4.2`). Native Telegram reactions are not claimed until verified by a real host-runtime run.

## Why it exists

Modern assistants do not only need more context. They need better judgment about what context means, when it should matter, and whether acting on it would be helpful, invasive, unsafe, or just socially clumsy.

Lumi Social Intelligence is built around a simple promise:

> Agents that remember carefully, read the room better, and know when not to act.

It is also built around a stricter self-improvement boundary:

> We are making the self-improvement loop something that is human-shaped.

That means **Lumi Social Intelligence** is not an auto-personality-rewriter. It is a governed reflection layer around agent self-improvement: observations can be scored, contradicted, reviewed, rejected, repaired, or promoted with explicit approval. The agent does not freely rewrite its identity after every interaction.

## Latest release: v0.4.3

**v0.4.3** is a Live Surface readiness release for **Gateway-start warmed context**, **warm brief handoffs before simple checks**, and **no silent long waits**.

Live Surface is the capability boundary between “the assistant has safe, warmed context” and “the assistant is allowed to act.” v0.4.3 tightens the startup and latency rule: Live Surface tools that belong on the surface must be ready after Gateway start, not lazily warmed on the first user need; simple familiar checks should get a tiny written acknowledgement before the tool path opens; and longer AutoResearch/tool paths must acknowledge the concrete next step in text before the user is left waiting. Emoji reactions remain an instant zero-tool-call lane only; they are not acknowledgements for longer or expensive tool waits.

### What v0.4.3 offers

- A public-safe `build_live_surface_autoresearch_readiness_plan` contract.
- A host startup binding requirement for `prefill_messages_file: ~/.hermes/state/live_surface_prefill_messages.json`, so Live Surface prefill context is ready before first user need.
- Gateway-start readiness semantics:
  - first user need warmup: forbidden
  - readiness phase: `gateway_start`
  - readiness is not permission to surface or mutate
- Pre-tool acknowledgement for simple familiar checks: warm, brief, human handoff before opening the machine room.
- Pre-tool acknowledgement for longer AutoResearch/tool paths.
- Explicit switch from emoji reaction to written text when the tool call is longer or expensive; reactions are not acknowledgements for expensive tool waits.
- Review-gated boundaries for memory writes, permission expansion, and runtime promotion.
- The v0.4.2 Next-Step Care contract remains available for instant/safe host actions.

## Current product form: public Live Surface for private workbenches

The current direction keeps **Lumi Social Intelligence** as the public, governed Live Surface contract for private/internal intelligence workbenches. The surface language is intentionally simple:

```text
Draft · Research · Review · Export · Help
```

Public Lumi documents the surface contract; private workbenches keep their source material, pack internals, and raw evidence behind their own review gates.

See [Live Surface workbench alignment](docs/live-surface-workbench-alignment.md).

## Previous release: v0.4.2

**v0.4.2** is a care release for **Live Surface instant reactions** and **Next-Step Care**.

Live Surface is the capability boundary between “the assistant has safe, warmed context” and “the assistant is allowed to act.” v0.4.2 tightens the UX rule we missed in the original release: safe tiny control-plane actions should be immediate and deterministic, while anything that may make the user wait, wonder, or feel out of control should narrate the next small step before acting.

### What v0.4.2 offers

- A public-safe `care_release` contract module.
- Instant reaction planning for host adapters:
  - default emoji: `❤️`
  - target source: existing host envelope only
  - agent loop/tool discovery: `0 tool calls`
  - DB archaeology/message guessing: forbidden
- Next-Step Care narration for multi-step, uncertain, or side-effectful work.
- Explicit fail-closed behavior when no safe host-envelope message target exists.
- Public evidence artifacts for the care release:
  - `docs/evidence/v0.4.2-care-release-evidence.json`
  - `docs/evidence/v0.4.2-care-release-evidence.md`

### What v0.4.2 does not claim

- Sending Telegram reactions from the public repository.
- Private Hermes runtime reads.
- Runtime config, scheduler, memory, or queue mutation.
- Guessing target message IDs.
- Replacing host-adapter integration work; this release defines the contract the host must implement.

See the [v0.4.2 release notes](docs/releases/v0.4.2.md) and [release evidence](docs/evidence/v0.4.2-care-release-evidence.md).

## The short concept

Lumi Social Intelligence helps an assistant answer four questions before it does anything socially meaningful:

1. **What do I know?** — governed memory and continuity.
2. **What does this moment mean?** — nuance, uncertainty, consent, and contradiction.
3. **Should I speak, wait, ask, or repair?** — presence and restraint.
4. **Is this context only warm, or is action approved?** — Live Surface.

The result is a safer path toward assistants that feel more socially aware without becoming unbounded, invasive, or weirdly overconfident.

## The product layer

| Product | Role | Public promise |
|---|---|---|
| **Lumi Layered Memory** | Context and continuity | Useful continuity. Clean boundaries. Receipts. No silent rewrites. |
| **Nuances** | Contextual appraisal | Notice lightly. Invite clearly. Repair quickly. Leave room. |
| **Presence** | Governed initiative | Soft presence. Clean boundaries. Quick repair. No stealing the feeling. |
| **Live Surface** | Review-gated host readiness | Warm safe context. Fail closed. Separate readiness from action. |

### Lumi Layered Memory

Lumi Layered Memory gives an assistant inspectable continuity: durable facts, preferences, project context, and memory receipts without silent identity rewrites or hidden behavioral drift.

### Nuances

Nuances reads the moment around the memory: corrections, consent signals, tone, uncertainty, emotional weight, context shifts, and whether an observation should become a durable adaptation at all.

### Presence

Presence decides what the assistant should do with that understanding: speak, wait, ask, act, repair, or hold silence. Presence is where restraint becomes a feature, not a missing capability.

### Live Surface

Live Surface keeps host capabilities legible and review-gated. It lets a host say, for example, “keep this ready,” “only surface this if relevant,” or “add Calendar later,” while preserving hard boundaries around personal data, external sends, durable memory, scheduler changes, and runtime mutation.

## Repository role

This repository is the curated release surface for Lumi Social Intelligence.

Development happens in private repositories:

- **Lumi Layered Memory**
- **Nuances**
- **Presence**
- **Autoresearch**

Tested, reviewed, public-safe updates are promoted here as versioned releases. This keeps the public doorway clean while the private workshop can stay messy, experimental, and properly fenced.

## Initial host target

The first planned distribution is **Lumi for Hermes**.

A future **Lumi for OpenClaw** distribution may be explored after compatibility research, but this repository intentionally does **not** include OpenClaw folders, installers, or support claims yet.

## Quickstart

Run the local release gate:

```bash
./scripts/release_check.sh
```

Use the public Live Surface control API:

```python
from lumi_social_intelligence import apply_review_gated_control

card = apply_review_gated_control(
    "keep this ready for when I leave",
    now="2026-07-11T17:00:00+07:00",
    source="host_public_api",
)

print(card["ack"])
print(card["side_effects"])
```

The API returns a review card plus side-effect counters. Safe readiness controls can be represented without private runtime reads or writes; personal-data requests fail closed until the surface is explicitly added and reviewed.

## Public-release boundary

This repository must never include:

- raw Autoresearch runs;
- confidential workbench workflows, local pack internals, private source ledgers, or raw evidence;
- private memories, diaries, chat logs, or personal coordinates;
- credentials, tokens, API keys, passwords, connection strings, or chat IDs;
- local runtime state, scheduler internals, cron/job queues, or wrappers;
- unreviewed generated artifacts;
- host-specific compatibility claims that have not been verified.

Every release must pass the local release gate:

```bash
./scripts/release_check.sh
```
